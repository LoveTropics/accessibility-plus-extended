## Mod Features

### **Read Blocks**

 __Disabled__ by default. This feature reads the name of the block the player is pointing at.

### **Read Entity**

 __Enabled__ by default. This feature reads the name of the entity the player is pointing at.

### **Fall Detector**

 __Disabled__ by default. This feature warns if the player heading towards a fall with depth greater than or equal to 5. It also warns the player if there is lava below the player's level.

### **Points of Interests**

 __Enabled__ by default. This feature detects if there is an exposed special block (like ores, crafting table, etc.) or entity nearby and plays a sound at the block's position. And on pressing 'Y', it locks onto the closest block or entity and unlocks when we press 'Alt + Y' or the block or entity nearby. The highest priority is hostile mob so if a hostile mob is in range it will lock onto that instead of other things. It also plays sound at dropped items in range and it also tracks Eye of Ender when we throw them.

### **Durability Checker**

 __Enabled__ by default. This feature adds the durability of the item in the item tooltip similar to advanced tootltips option (F3 + H) but it adds the durability right after the item's name. And I will also add warnings when item is low on durability.

## Settings

Settings menu can be accessed by opening the configuration menu (the default key to open it is B) and selecting the settings option from it.
