## Mod Features

### Read Blocks

 __Disabled__ by default. This feature reads the name of the block the player is pointing at.

### Read Entity

 __Enabled__ by default. This feature reads the name of the entity the player is pointing at.

### Fall Detector

 __Disabled__ by default. This feature warns if the player heading towards a fall with depth greater than or equal to 5. It also warns the player if there is lava below the player's level.

### Ore Detector

 __Disabled__ by default. This feature detects if there is an exposed ore block nearby and plays a sound (item pickup sound by default) at the block's position. You can choose to play a custom sound from the config menu but it is experimental at the moment. You can also change the volume and pitch of the sound. The default value for volume is __0.25__ and that of pitch is __-5__.

### Durability Checker

 __Enabled__ by default. This feature adds the durability of the item in the item tooltip similar to optifine but it adds the durability right after the item's name.
