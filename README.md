## New Keybindings

- **B** = Open configuration menu.

## Mod Features

### Read Blocks

 __Disabled__ by default. This feature reads the name of the block the player is pointing at.

### Read Entity

 __Enabled__ by default. This feature reads the name of the entity the player is pointing at.

### Mob Locking System

This feature locks onto a closest mob within a 10 blocks radius. The keybinding for this feature is **'Y'** and **'Alt +Y'** to disable locking.

### Fall Detector

 __Disabled__ by default. This feature warns if the player heading towards a fall with depth greater than or equal to 5. It also warns the player if there is lava below the player's level.

### Ore Detector

 __Disabled__ by default. This feature detects if there is an exposed ore block nearby and plays a sound (item pickup sound by default) at the block's position. You can choose to play a custom sound from the config menu but it is experimental at the moment. You can also change the volume and pitch of the sound. The default value for volume is __0.25__ and that of pitch is __-5__.

### Durability Checker

 __Enabled__ by default. This feature adds the durability of the item in the item tooltip similar to advanced tootltips option (F3 + H) but it adds the durability right after the item's name. And I will also add warnings when item is low on durability.
